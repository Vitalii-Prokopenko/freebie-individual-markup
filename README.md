The repository stores the files of an additional project that I performed by myself while studying the HTML+CSS 1.0 course on Full Stack Developer FSOn 72 programm at GoIt school.
The template Figma file is in the folder "template".
Styles for tablet and mobile phone are written by me additionally to consolidate the acquired knowledge.
The animation on scroll is an additional feature as well (https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/).

WTAT SHOULD BE ADDED (still for practicing):
1. Modal windows for displaying content after clicking buttons.
2. A slider for the posts-tall section.

WHAT BUGS ARE STILL THERE TO BE FIXED:
1. The mobile menu does not close by itself after selecting a menu item.
2. Images do not load on a mobile phone (iPhone 11).

Comments and suggestions are welcomed.
